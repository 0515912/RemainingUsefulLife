RemainingUsefulLife
===================

It is a collection of all kinds of feature extraction and recognition algorithms.
In generally, there are three stages for the data-driven remaining useful life estimation:
data-preprocessing, feature extraction and pattern recognition(also some regression algorithm).

1.Data-preprocessing:Data preprocessing is an important step for signal analysis. 


2.Features extraction: Features extraction
